# Deep-learning-assignment-2

Here are the codes of deep learning assinment2, including 3 .ipynb files, model3_original_data.ipynb[1],UMAP.ipynb[2] and model1_t_sne_nocomb.ipynb[3].
File[1] for the model without any dimension reduction method, file[2] is the model that has been trained after using UMAP to reduce the dimension of data, and file[3] uses t-SNE to reduce the dimension.
